            <h2>Prologue: How it Started</h2>
            <p>Years ago, I remember writing to Apple asking how to get my music on iTunes. Apple Music wasn't even born yet. They replied—professionally, helpfully—introducing me to music distributors that I didn't know existed.</p>
            <p>Apple literally started me on this journey. The irony of what follows has not been lost on me.</p>

            <h2>Day 1: The Optimistic Beginning</h2>
            <p>I wrote my debut book on artist rights history in Tamil (my language), starting from before the printing press. Apparently, I'm drawn to obsolete battles, because next I decided to become a classical composer in the streaming age.</p>
            <p>I was inspired by the sheet music era and stories of Handel and Bach (who never had to argue with an algorithm about genre classifications), I moved from my DAW to scoring software. When I finished my first Piano work, I felt accomplished. After years of writing sync music in isolation, I was ready to share something that was truly mine.</p>

            <h2>Day 13: The First Encounter</h2>
            <p>RouteNote used to be free and took WAV files. Now they're still free but only accept MP3s for the free plan. Look, I get the economics—storage costs money, and I'm not exactly generating Spotify millions. Algorithms don't chase me and I don't chase them; we have a mutual non-aggression pact.</p>
            <p>But twenty days for customer support? Twenty days! Wagner could have written another Ring Cycle. That's when I realized the distribution landscape had transformed while I was peacefully writing sync music.</p>

            <h2>Day 45: CDBaby and the Discovery</h2>
            <p>I recalled having a one decade old release with CDBaby. Decided to move to CDBaby—not free, but they responded before I forgot I'd written to them. Days later, I found my music on Apple Music Classical. I didn't even know this existed. It's like discovering a secret room in your house with your furniture already there.</p>
            <p>Encouraged, I released a Sonatina and started a Theme and Variations that took sleepless nights.</p>

            <h2>Day 73: The Hunt for HD Audio</h2>
            <p>CDBaby doesn't accept lossless audio. Yes, most people listen on phone speakers that make everything sound underwater. But I wanted to preserve the rosin of the first chairs for the twelve audiophiles who care. They're my people. I was writing my new Passacaglia for them.</p>
            <p>I decided to try a distributor marketing special platform relationships. I subscribed, submitted, and then...</p>

            <h2>Day 89: The Genre Wars</h2>
            <p>They insisted my classical work should be labeled "Instrumental."</p>
            <p>"But it's a Theme and Variations. In C Major. With…."</p>
            <p>"Instrumental."</p>
            <p>"It follows classical form—"</p>
            <p>"<strong>INSTRUMENTAL.</strong>"</p>
            <p>They distributed it their way. Then it appeared in Qobuz's Pop section. POP. My "Echoes in My Chamber: Theme and Variations in C Major, Op.3, No.1" sitting next to contemporary hits. That was the day I dropped opus numbers from titles. If you can't beat them, stop giving them ammunition.</p>
            <p>Don't ask me why I use opus numbers. I know I am not Beethoven. He started losing hearing at my age, but I am just developing tinnitus. The opus numbers were my attempt at a legacy.</p>

         
            <h2>Day 112: The Landscape Survey</h2>
            <p>Back to CDBaby, who distributed it properly without drama. They have the competence. Revolutionary.</p>
              <p>But still no HD audio. The search continued:</p>
            <p>Ditto Music: No lossless<br>
            DistroKid: No lossless<br>
            LANDr: No Classical to Apple Music<br>
            LANDr: No Classical to Apple Music<br> 
            iMusician: Want classical AND lossless? That's their most expensive tier. Though credit where due—they keep your music up even if you stop paying.<br>
            Soundrop: The interface seemed to be having an existential crisis. Each edit created a new release. But wait—they accept lossless, and at $0.99 per track? Their system must be flooded with everyone writing a passacaglia for strings to leave a legacy.</p>


          
                  
            <h2>Day 124: Understanding the Game</h2>
            <p>I get it now. Serious distributors are expensive or invite-only because they're filtering for people who actually make money. Classical metadata requires extra work that isn't worth it for bedroom producers generating three streams annually.</p>
            <p>Then Soundrop raised prices to $4.99. I actually felt relieved. Even their interface seems to be relieved from creating new releases on its own.( pay-per-release is better than subscriptions, even if they are a bit more expensive.) </p>

            <h2>Day 126: The TuneCore Tragedy</h2>
            <p>Desperate, I paid TuneCore's annual subscription. Then discovered:</p>
            <p>They only have "Classical Crossover" (Bach feat. Billie Eilish?)<br>
            They can't deliver to Apple Music <br>
            Refund policy: "All sales are final" (That is not a refund policy!)</p>
            <p>My only real complaint? Tell me upfront. Don't let me pay THEN mention you can't deliver to a platform I want to.</p>
            <p>I created a ticket and filed a complaint with their payment processor. Used words like "misrepresentation" and "undisclosed limitations."</p>

            <h2>The Plot Twist</h2>
            <p>Just after filing disputes against TuneCore, I went to Soundrop.</p>
            <p>Funny thing - I'd set up this release at $0.99 weeks earlier but never submitted, convinced I needed something better with real human support. Post-TuneCore, I finally clicked submit on what I already had.Generally. </p>

            <h2>Epilogue: Into the Unknown</h2>
            <p>Got an email from another distributor: "You didn't finish your release... The world is waiting..."</p>
            <p>The world might be waiting, but apparently not for classical music in lossless audio. Unless you use the platform everyone says to avoid.</p>
            <p>The landscape's grown more complex since I started. Spotify's "artificial streaming policy" has everyone paranoid—distributors can't tell if music is human-composed or AI-generated. In a world where AI can write "Classical Crossover" faster than you can say "Bach feat. Billie Eilish," everyone's suspicious of everything. No wonder they're defaulting to defensive positions.</p>
            <p>The Passacaglia isn't released for streaming yet. I won't be surprised if it lands in Death Metal somewhere. But I'm prepared now—it's released on Bandcamp, where genre is what I say it is.</p>
            <p>The world is waiting? Let it wait. I am figuring out Bandcamp.</p>
